# Thesis Template for LaTeX

- The latest version looks like: [download artefact "thesis.pdf" of latest build](https://gitlab.mrt.uni-karlsruhe.de/MRT/thesis_template_latex/builds/artifacts/master/file/thesis.pdf?job=compile_pdf)

## Usage
- fork (=make your own copy of) this repo before making changes
- change the structure, add/remove packages, ...

#### Forking into the SCC gitlab
- as the MRT gitlab is only accessible from inside the institute, usage of the SCC gitlab is recommended for your thesis
  - create your own thesis project:
     - https://git.scc.kit.edu/
     - login with your `uxxxx`-Account
     - click on "new project"
     - chose the name, e.g. "my_thesis"
  - clone the git repo: `git clone https://gitlab.mrt.uni-karlsruhe.de/MRT/thesis_template_latex.git`
  - look at the remotes in this git repo: `git remote -v`
  - remove the MRT remote `git remote remove origin`
  - add the SCC remote `git remote add origin https://git.scc.kit.edu/uxxxx/my_thesis.git` (replace `uxxxx` with your SCC account and `my_thesis` with your project name)
  - push to the SCC remote `git push -u origin master`
- now, your thesis is accessible here: `https://git.scc.kit.edu/uxxxx/my_thesis.git`
  - this SCC repo is "independent" of the MRT template repo https://gitlab.mrt.uni-karlsruhe.de/MRT/thesis_template_latex.git
  - your commits will (only) be pushed to the SCC gitlab
  - if you want to clone your repo, use `git clone https://git.scc.kit.edu/uxxxx/my_thesis.git`

## Compiling

#### Prerequisites
- use of TeXmaker is recommended (all platforms)
- in order for `makeglossaries` to work, your latex installation folder must be added to `$PATH`
  - find out the folder: type `$ which latex` in console
  - add folder to `$PATH`:
    - in console: `$ PATH=$PATH:<latexpath>` (replace `<latexpath>`)
    - in TeXmaker: Options -> Configure TeXmaker -> "Add to path:" `<latexpath>`
  - otherwise, you will get errors like `***Call to xindy failed***`
- if using TeXmaker: configure "makeglossaries" as user defined command
  - user -> user commands -> edit user commands
  - menuitem: `makeglossaries`; command: `makeglossaries %`

#### Compiling order
- either in console or in TeXmaker
  - `pdflatex thesis`
  - `bibtex thesis`
  - `makeglossaries thesis` (if using glossaries)
  - `pdflatex thesis`
  - `pdflatex thesis`
- or use latexmk
  - see http://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk (included in TeXLive and MiKTeX)
  - `latexmk -pdf` to generate the pdflatex
  - `latexmk -c` to delete the regeneratable files generated by latex and bibtex except pdf

## Other Information

#### Online References
- as webpages are not considered citeable, but sometimes pictures or sensor characteristics are taken from there, an additional list is introduced; its use is neither comfortable nor obligatory, but its a way to avoid footnotes for online references

#### Gitlab CI
- whenever you push, gitlab will execute what you specify in the `.gitlab-ci.yml`, this is used to keep track of the generated pdf-files without overloading this repo
- you can see the builds by klicking on [pipelines](https://gitlab.mrt.uni-karlsruhe.de/MRT/thesis_template_latex/pipelines) (here or above)
- in the SCC gitlab, [continous integration](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/) most likely won't work, therefore, remove the `.gitlab-ci.yml` in your repo.
